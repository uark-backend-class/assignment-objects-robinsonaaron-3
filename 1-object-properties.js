/*
Exercise 1: Object Properties
Create a function called `createMessage` that takes an object with `name` and `age` properties as an argument.
The function should return a string in the format "name is age years old."
For example, createMessage({ name: "Alice", age: 25 }) should return "Alice is 25 years old."
