/**
 * Exercise: Create a Book Class
 *
 * Overview:
 * In this exercise, you will create a class named `Book`. This class will represent a book and will include properties to track its title, author, and publication year.
 *
 * Objectives:
 * - Learn to define a class.
 * - Understand how to use constructors for setting the initial state of an object.
 * - Practice creating methods that provide useful operations on the book data.
 *
 * Instructions:
 *
 * 1. Define the Class:
 *    - Create a class named `Book`.
 *    - The constructor should initialize the following properties:
 *      - `title`: a string representing the title of the book.
 *      - `author`: a string representing the author of the book.
 *      - `year`: a number representing the year the book was published.
 *
 * 2. Add Methods:
 *    - `getBookInfo()`: This method should return a string that includes the title, author, and publication year in a readable format, e.g., "Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, published in 1997".
 *    - `getAge()`: This method calculates and returns the age of the book based on the current year.
 *
 * 3. Test Your Class:
 *    - Create an instance of the `Book` class.
 *    - Call the `getBookInfo()` method to display the book's details.
 *    - Call the `getAge()` method to display the age of the book.
 *
 * Example Usage and Expected Output:
 *    const myBook = new Book("Harry Potter", "J.K. Rowling", 1997);
 *    console.log(myBook.getBookInfo());  // "Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, published in 1997"
 *    console.log(myBook.getAge());       // Assuming the current year is 2024, "27 years old"
